#My Personal Website

I decided to build this website so that I can gain a better understanding of HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap.
I've always wanted to experiment with Front End and start projects outside of my school curriculum .  Also it's pretty sick to have your own website.

Still to be Added:
About me Page,
Project Page
